## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really had fun creating this, i played around with a lot of things in javascript and also it was my first time implementing different color themes and got to learn how to adjust a page's design/color based on system preference.I also structured my code in a modular way especially by using Mixins, overall i enjoyed building thisðŸ˜Š.

### Continued development

I might consider additional functionality beyond basic calculation like log,square root, etc in the future

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) - This helped me with understandingthe `prefers-color-scheme property` since i have never used it before.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI2GwL--ll8&t=908s) - Here i got to understand how to format a number to add comma by using the `toLocalString` property.

```js
const secondChallenge = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
