## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology for class naming

### What I learned

- I learnt more of Flexbox usage for responsive design
- I deepened my knowledge in the usage of Sass, since i myself is a newbie in web development, this helped cemented the knowldge of using Sass, i am pretty confident in using Sass for my next projects ðŸ˜Š.
- This is my first time going with the mobile first approach in building a component or a layout, i pretty much can say i enjoyed it and find it easier.


```js
const firstChallenge = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/adaptive-photo-layout-with-flexbox/) - This helped me in   making an adaptive image layout that fits the card perfectly using flexbox, y'all can check it out

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Ofcourse i stackoverflowed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜Ž while i was stuck in some areas for instance when my sass code is not compiling correctly.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This helped me remember some certain properties i forgot along the way like the `mix-blend-mode css` property i used for the image overlay.
